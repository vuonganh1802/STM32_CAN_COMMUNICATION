# STM32_CAN_COMMUNICATION
This is my first project using STM32 for communication between CAN buses.
# About STM32 project
An STM32 CAN communication project involves setting up a system where STM32 microcontrollers communicate over a CAN bus network by using STM32CubeIDE. The key components include STM32F466 microcontrollers, CAN transceivers, a physical CAN bus, a power sup- ply, and any necessary peripherals and sensors.
